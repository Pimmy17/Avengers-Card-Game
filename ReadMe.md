# Andy's Mini Game App - Avengers Matching Card Game

Made through a combination of a Northcoders sprint task and a YouTube tutorial.

### Aim of the Game:

The aim is to match a card with it's pair, which is face down within the collection of cards.
If two incorrect cards are turned over, they will be flipped back to face down after a time delay.
If all cards are correctly matched then a text overlay will appear saying Avengers Assembled!

### Setup Instructions:

1. **Clone:**

On the [main page](https://github.com/Pimmy17/Avengers-Card-Game) of the repo, click on the **Green** button that says 'Code'. From the drop down menu, either click the overlapping squares button to the right of the HTTPS address (this automatically copies the .git address) or highlight the whole HTTPS address and right click and select copy.
Then head over to your terminal command line and enter in:

```
$ git clone <insert copied HTTPS address>
i.e $ git clone https://github.com/Pimmy17/Avengers-Card-Game.git
```

After running this it will ask you to enter your github username and password/access token.

Finally to access the file in VS Code:

```
Enter the Project file using:
$ cd Avengers-Card-Game
Then
$ code .
```

2. **Running The App:**

In order to run the App, no dependencies are required, instead head over to the file titled `main.html` and `right click` the file.
A drop down menu should appear, with one of the options saying `Open with Live Server`.
Select this option and the game will appear in a new window in your browser.

NB. The app is not currently hosted and has only been set up for being played on laptop screens.

Enjoy!
